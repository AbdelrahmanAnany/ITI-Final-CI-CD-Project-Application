## 5th Part: Build CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins

#### Once a commit is made Jenkins will:
- Build an image from Dockerfile
- Push the image to DockerHub
- Apply deployment for the app based on the image
- Apply LoadBalancer service for the app

### 1. Add Credentials in Jenkins
- #### DockerHub Credentials
> Add your DockerHub Credentials `(Username and Password)` and save the id with this value `DockerHub-Credential`.

- #### Service Account Credentials
> Go to GCP Console and navigate to Â `Service accounts` from the `IAM & Admin` page.

> Click on your `Service accounts` then click on the `KEYS` Tab then `Add Key` then `Create new key`, for `Key type` Select `JSON`

> Now go to Jenkins and Make a New credential, select `Secret file` for `credentials kind` then upload the Service Account you just downloaded.
> for `Secret ID` enter `gcpCredential`.
